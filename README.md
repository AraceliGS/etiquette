# Etiquette for digital `Laboratorians`

> Etiquette (/ˈɛtᵻˌkɛt/ or /ˈɛtᵻkᵻt/, French: [e.ti.kɛt]) is a code of behavior that delineates expectations for social behavior according to contemporary conventional norms within a society, social class, or group.

Time is of the essence, and communication can be time consuming. In order to
prevent headaches, misunderstandings and reduce communication issues, we ask
all team members and contributors to abide by a set conventions outlined here.

## General

Pretty text is not just easier to read, it is also easier and quicker to
understand. In real time communications (ie: Slack) it's all about quick, expressive, short messages. But in all other forms of writing we have the
advantage of being able to stare at our words after the fact and then iterate
over them. So we should always aim to exploit that fundamental advantage when
writing down our thoughts, proposals, arguments, explanations, ...

* **Think** before you write.
* **Read** before you send.
* Add **context**.
* Careful **grammar** and **spelling** are not optional.
* **Punctuation** has meaning, use it as part of your message.
* **White space** matters.
* Be corteous and kind, but clinical when details matter.
* Be transparent and inviting.

## Avatar

* Use [Gravatar](https://gravatar.com/) (this will be your identity on many
  different services)
* Use a _memorable_ picture, avatar or image. **Default profile pics suck!**
* Try to use the **same pic across services**. It really helps add context,
  instantly knowing who you are, who is involved in what conversation, ... in
  the end it helps build familiarity and trust.

## Slack

* A simple reaction can be really helpful and meaningful.
* Share stuff worth sharing.
* Remember it's a chat app, if your message does not have a "real time" or
  "group" nature it should probably go elsewhere.
* Do not stalk.
* Messages and conversations are transient.
* Use @mentions to make sure people are notified, but there's no need to
  @mention them every time we refer to them.
* If it is **important** and does not need to be real-time it should probably
  be an email.

## Email

* Favour plain text email when written by a human (it's ok for newsletters,
  and other automated emails to be branded in html format).
* Keep your signature simple. No need for unnecessary clutter.
* Only add a full "footer type signature" in your first communication with
  someone. You only give someone your business card once.
* You don't need to add your signature to every response.
* When replying take the time to ask yourself the question: "reply", "reply to
  all" or "reply to some".
* An email without a subject is not helpful.
* The subject is important and should summarise your message. If you can not
  summarise it, you probably want to split it in more than one email.

## Plain text

When writing plain text (be it a markdown document, code, an issue, a blog post,
a forum message, ...), we follow these conventions:

* Use `ut8` charset
* Use spaces instead of tabs
* Use 2 spaces for indentation
* Avoid trailing whitespace
* Include blank line at the end of file

This is how our standard [`.editorconfig`](https://editorconfig.org/) looks
like:

```
root = true

[*]
charset = utf-8
indent_style = space
indent_size = 2
trim_trailing_whitespace = true
insert_final_newline = true
```

## Markdown

* As a digital native, you are expected to be familiar with markdown syntax.
* Use markdown in Slack, Medium, GitHub, ... even in emails when applicable.

## Medium / Blogs

* Ask for peer review
* Review others
* Use quotes and add references
* Research is not optional
* Aim for literary value: you are telling a story

## Forums / Communities

* Search before you ask
* When asking questions, always provide context
* Read before you post or reply
* Be kind and welcoming
* Celebrate contribution
* Always be transparent
* Be critical of ideas, not people

## GitHub & Git

* Always create a `.gitignore` file when you create a new repo.
* Always create a `README.md` file when you create a new repo.
* Write commit messages starting with a verb in 3rd person present tense
  describing what the change set does (it "fixes something...", "adds
  something").
* Add references to issues in commit messages, other issues and pull requests.
* Use `Closes #n` to have issues automatically closed on push.
* Use multiline commit messages when appropriate.
* Use markdown profusely.
* Always provide context when reporting _issues_.

## Contributing

* Pull, not push
* Learn, follow, nurture and contribute to conventions
* ...
